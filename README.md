## Deliverable 1 

For the first deliverable, I added code that scraped data from a website in order to add full-resolution images of Mars hemispheres and the titles of those images to the website. 

## Deliverable 2 

For the second deliverable, I used Python and HTML to update the Mongo database and modify the index.html file. 

## Deliverable 3 

For thee third deliverable, I used bootstrap to update the web app in order to make it mobile responsive, and I added two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it look better. I changed the colors of the button once it is highlighted, and the color of the Mars Hemispheres title.
